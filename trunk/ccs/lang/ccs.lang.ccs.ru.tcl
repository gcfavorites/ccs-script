##Camelot Software Planning
##From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
##Jump to: navigation, search
##Camelot Software Planning is a Japanese video game developer established in 1990 best known for partnering with Nintendo on many of Nintendo's spin-off franchise games such as Mario Tennis and Mario Golf, besides the Game Boy Advance console role-playing game series Golden Sun. Prior to their relationship with Nintendo, Camelot was credited with the successful games Shining Force III for the Sega Saturn and Hot Shots Golf for the PlayStation.
##Camelot was originally a sub-division of Sega known as Sonic! Software Planning that was formed to create the Shining in the Darkness game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, alongside with Climax Entertainment. It also developed other successful games in the franchise like Shining Force: The Legacy of Great Intention and Shining Force II: Ancient Sealing.
##In 1995, Camelot officially separated from Sega but agreed to keep developing the Shining games and would not release any games for rival systems that would hurt the Shining franchise.
##In late 1998, Sega began focusing their resources on the Dreamcast, leaving Camelot with their last scenario for Shining Force 3 for the Sega Saturn in jeopardy. Camelot wrapped up Shining Force III and formed a partnership with Nintendo.
##They have recently expressed interest in developing new Golden Sun and Shining Force titles, but nothing is official.

#"on February 17,2005 IGN anounced that there "will" be a RPG game coming out possibly for the Wii" February 17, 2005 - Development studio Camelot Software Planning, best known for their Mario Tennis, Mario Golf, and Golden Sun games, stated repeatedly in the past that it would like to make another role-playing game. For years rumors fueled by Japanese reports alleged that the company was underway with a GameCube sequel to Golden Sun. However, a Camelot "Help Wanted" ad placed in the latest issue of Japan's Famitsu Magazine this week suggests that the studio's next RPG will be for a next-generation system, most likely for the Wii.
#In big, white text directly in the middle of the full-page ad, Camelot writes: "Now seeking staff for development of an RPG targeting a next-generation system."
#While this placement does not directly confirm that the RPG is for the Wii, it seems the most logical conclusion based on Camelot's very close relationship with Nintendo and previous comments made by the studio's president Hiroyuki Takahashi. Last month, he confirmed that Camelot is not currently underway with any DS projects, but seemed to hint that it was developing a new RPG for an unspecified system.
#"We love RPGs a lot and we profoundly adore the universe we created with the Golden Sun series on GBA," he replied when he was asked if Camelot was making a Golden Sun sequel for consoles. "At the moment, though, it is impossible for us to share information on this subject with you and so our answer is neither yes nor no." Takahashi added that Camelot does have projects underway and that he expects it "will be able to show some new things at E3."
